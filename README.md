A web API for [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) implemented with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com).

This is a part of the following paper. Please [cite](#citation) it when you use this project. You will also cite [the original SAM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643) and [the MobileSAM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14289).

## Install

Create a conda environment.

```bash
conda create -n samapi -y python=3.10
conda activate samapi
```

If you're using a computer with CUDA-compatible GPU, install `cudatoolkit`.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge -y cudatoolkit=11.8
```

If you're using a computer with CUDA-compatible GPU on Windows, install `torch` with GPU-support with the following command.

```bash
# Windows with CUDA-compatible GPU only
python -m pip install "torch>=2.3.1,<2.4" torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Install `samapi` and its dependencies.

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/gnaneshrasineni/samapi.git
```

If you are using WSL2, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` will need to be updated as follows.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/wsl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Update

If you want to update the samapi server, run the following command in the conda environment.

```bash
python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/gnaneshrasineni/samapi.git
```

## Usage

### Launch a server

Since `v0.4.0`, it is important to launch the server with `--workers 2` (or more) to enable cancellation of a download of a weights file.

```bash
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1 # Required for running on Apple silicon
uvicorn samapi.main:app --workers 2
```

The command above will launch a server at http://localhost:8000.

```
INFO:     Started server process [21258]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to access remotely, you may need to launch with `--host 0.0.0.0`.

```bash
uvicorn samapi.main:app --workers 2 --host 0.0.0.0
```

For more information, see [uvicorn documentation](https://www.uvicorn.org/#command-line-options).

### Troubleshooting

If you try to process a large image and receive the following error, you may need to increase the `PIL.Image.MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS` value (default: `89478485`), or completely disable it (i.e. set the variable to the empty valie).

```bash
PIL.Image.DecompressionBombError: Image size (xxxxxxxxx pixels) exceeds limit of 178956970 pixels, could be decompression bomb DOS attack.
```

In Linux and MacOS, you can set the environment variable as follows.

```bash
export PIL_MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS="" # or specific value (integer)
```

In Windows, you can set the environment variable as follows.

```cmd
set PIL_MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS="" # or specific value (integer)
```

	abstract = {Deep learning is becoming more prominent in cell image analysis. However, collecting the annotated data required to train efficient deep-learning models remains a major obstacle. I demonstrate that functional performance can be achieved even with sparsely annotated data. Furthermore, I show that the selection of sparse cell annotations significantly impacts performance. I modified Cellpose and StarDist to enable training with sparsely annotated data and evaluated them in conjunction with ELEPHANT, a cell tracking algorithm that internally uses U-Net based cell segmentation. These results illustrate that sparse annotation is a generally effective strategy in deep learning-based cell image segmentation. Finally, I demonstrate that with the help of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), it is feasible to build an effective deep learning model of cell image segmentation from scratch just in a few minutes.Competing Interest StatementKS is employed part-time by LPIXEL Inc.},
